# Guess-the-Gracht-City

Game Mechanism

In Guess the City, players must identify a hidden satellite image of Dutch cities that surrounded by a "Singelgracht" . The image is initially obscured, and players must navigate a snake around the screen. Each time the snake crashes, part of the image is revealed, giving them another chance to guess the city's name. Players have a limited number of attempts—each incorrect guess costs a heart. The game ends when the player either guesses correctly or runs out of hearts.

What is Singelgracht?

The term "singel" refers to moat and gracht refers to the historic canal systems that characterize many Dutch cities. Originally built for transportation, defense, and water management, these canals have become an iconic feature of cities like Utrecht, Leiden, and Delft. The distinctive circular or grid-like layouts of grachten are easily recognizable from above.
